# Tech Blog

## Description

This is a project which was developed to be a application containing a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, using MVC architecture and Handlebars.

By far my most challenging assignment to date, not only because of the amount of work but just so much going on! 
I can say I tired my best, the project is still a little buggy as it will not navigate to the homepage but I already took far to long,
I am hoping with feed back provided it will guide me to discovering it, I just can no longer spend time as I am getting a bit behind.
Great project, really helped me see the bigger picture.
